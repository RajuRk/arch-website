                  <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
                  <p>With the increasing demand for green buildings, it is vital to understand the right approach towards constructing such structures that would minimize the detrimental impacts of construction on the planet, while creating a healthy and comfortable living/working environment with zero or minimal incremental cost.</p>
                  <p>A green building has lower resource consumption as compared to conventional buildings, while enhancing the overall health and well-being of the users. There are a number of tangible and intangible benefits offered by green buildings.</p>
                  <p>Green buildings consume 40% to 60% (depending on the range of measures adopted) lesser electricity as compared to conventional buildings.</p>
                  <p>This is primarily because they rely on passive architectural interventions in the building design, with highly efficient materials and technologies in the engineering design. For meeting the energy needs, they attempt to work towards on-site energy generation through renewable energy utilization.</p>

         <div className=''>
            <p>For instance, solar thermal systems can help generate hot water and replace the conventional electrical geyser in the buildings. Solar PV (photovoltaic) panels or Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) can help generate electricity which can reduce the buildings dependence on grid power. They consume 40% to 80% (depending on the range of measures adopted) less water as compared to conventional buildings.</p>
            <p>By utilizing ultra-low-flow fixtures, dual plumbing systems, waste water recycling systems, and rainwater harvesting, these buildings not only reduce their demand for water but also consider on-site supply options to cater to their internal and external (landscape) water demands.</p>
            <p>Additionally, green buildings generate less waste, lesser air, water, and soil pollution both during construction and operation. It also accounts for proper safety, health, and sanitation facilities for the construction workers (during construction) and the occupants (while in use). It restricts the use of high Ozone Depleting Potential (ODP) substances in their systems as well as in the interior finishes.</p>
            <p>The return on investment in green buildings is fast, by virtue of lower maintenance and energy costs as compared to the conventional buildings and offer branding opportunities and an edge over others in the market.</p>

              <h4>AIM</h4>
              <p>Green Building promotes the efficiency of buildings with regards to the use of water, energy and materials while reducing the building's impact on individual's health and the environment through better design, construction, operation, maintenance and removal.</p>
              <p>The related concepts of sustainable development and sustainability are integral to green building. Effective green building can lead to:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Reduced operating costs by increasing productivity and using less energy and water</li>
                  <li>Improved public and occupant health due to improved indoor air quality</li>
                  <li>Reduced environmental impacts by, for example, reducing storm water runoff  and the heating effect</li>

                 <p>Design an sustainable house in POOJA’S ICONIC CITY 8cents @Rathinam tech zone campus, Eachnari.</p>
                 <p>Sustainable houses are those that, being respectful of the environment, take advantage of all available resources to reduce energy consumption and, therefore, help save on household bills, something that is always appreciated.</p>

              <h4>BRIEF</h4>
              <p><strong>Awareness: </strong>Understanding and researching in-depth into the issue that is caused due to the need for expansion.</p>
              <p><strong>Contex conscious: </strong>Study the vernacular and sustainable construction methods and building materials that can be used to create the symbiosis that exists without harming.</p>
              <p><strong>Climate responsive: </strong>Study the climate of the context with respect to its extreme and normal weather conditions. As the rainforest offers an extreme context through various aspects.</p>
              <p><strong>Compact: </strong>Understand the scale required to be built and the scope and limitations the context offers.</p>
              <p>The above objectives can be a point of beginning to conceive this design. Participants can assume their contexts and user group on the basis of their concepts and designs.</p>

              <p>Site Area: 3484 sqft (8cents)</p>
              <p>Height limit: G+2</p>
              <p>FSI (Floor Space Index): 1.5</p>
              <p>Maximum plot coverage:60%</p>
              <p>Space ideas:</p>

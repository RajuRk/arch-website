                    <p>The competition is to design a pavilion - a community space, that can be shared equally by one and all in the transforming urban settings. It could be a new refuge, an inspiring and calming breather!</p>
                    <p>The pavilion can be a place catering to various urban activities; where it can become a place to relax and to wander in, a small community space for to gather, discuss and even loiter. to be built using sustainable building material like bamboo.</p>
                    <p>Another objective of this design challenge is to raise the awareness of bamboo as a sustainable building material. Pa1iicipants have to leverage bamboo as the primary material in reconfiguring the pub I ic space, by creating a communion with the site and its surroundings.</p>
                    <p>However, the proposed design would inspire the future generations of the community to make architecture of bamboo as a reoccurring phenomenon of ecological conception.</p>

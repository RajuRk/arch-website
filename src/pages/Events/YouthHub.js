                    <p>Youth in a country is the most viable and potential human resource not only in population structure but also in social structure. They should be given the appropriate space and opportunity to exercise their talents and knowledge for the movement of society in a positive progress and an urban public space that have every possible facility for the growth of the urban youth in every sector of life starting from art and creativity, sports and athletics, technology and entertainment to loving the Mother Nature.</p>
                    <p>The design encourages students to do an extensive study of what today's young people need and to understand their demands from the present-day society. Addressing this concern and providing a suitable solution will nurture them to grow into the promising adults of tomorrow. The need to establish a space exclusive for them is significant as they are the most vulnerable and susceptible, to the worlds every treacherous event and hence are in need of a place to outlet their ideas, experiment and develop, with a positive and competitive mind. The design is developed as an urban space, dedicated to young people devoting time and energy, to culture and shape them.</p>

                <h4>AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT</h4>
                 <p>The sole purpose of this project is to be a breathing and breeding arena of urban youths who can channelize their extremely eager passion and energy on the variety of fruitful activities that this place is going to offer them. This place would be an amalgamation of fun and productive events for the urban youth to enjoy their time and nourish their growing mind. It should be the place where they will learn to respect the Mother Nature and the beauty of the environment; they will grasp the ever-entertaining essence of creativity and art, and grab and feel the raging adrenaline rush of various sports and athletics with a positive competitive mind.</p>
                 <p>The project also determines to help build a healthy relationship among the various groups in the society. This space can be the ultimate zone for all the youths of the city where they will come and feel relaxed. Youths from all over the place will come under the same roof for a cause or reason or for pure entertainment. This place can be a zone for progressive protests and rebels by the youths. As we have seen in the past years, a number of issues rose up at different time and were solved purposefully, all because of the initiative of the younger population of our country. The sole purpose of the project is to become the ultimate area for the urban youths from all over the earth to come around and interact, share their ideas and views, how they can learn about one another and the way they want to invest their energy in whatever things they like doing. The space should be designed in a way that will attract the urban youths automatically rather than forcing them to do something. The activities and events included in the center for their relaxation and mind empowerment should be magnetic and catchy enough to make them come at that place by themselves.</p>
